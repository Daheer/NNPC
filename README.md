# NNPC

This repository contains the code for the projects completed during my internship at NNPC. The projects include:

- [NNPC Chatbot](Chatbot/README.md): I developed an intelligent chatbot for NNPC's website using open-source Language Learning Models (LLMs). The chatbot was integrated with a knowledge base, created using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), to provide accurate and relevant information about NNPC.

- [Office Word Plugin](Office%20Plugin/README.md): I created a custom plugin for NNPC's Microsoft Office Suite that uses LLMs to perform summarization tasks. This plugin was designed to improve productivity by integrating intelligence into the staff's workflow.

- [App Development / Design](Attendace%20Website/README.md): I designed various user interfaces for NNPC, including error pages, login pages, and settings pages. I also developed a fully functional web application for automating the intern check-in/check-out process.

- Solutions Design: I learned about project management and solutions analysis. As part of this, I created a Business Requirements Document and a Market Research Document for an arbitrary company - GreeNNPC.
